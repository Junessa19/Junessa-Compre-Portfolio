    <p>
        I am an IT student who is determined to graduate in this field despite
        the challenges I face in taking this course. The IT course is not easy
        because it requires strong logical thinking, problem-solving skills,
        especially in programming, system development, and technical concepts.
        <br><br>
        Because of these challenges, I motivate myself to work harder, learn
        continuously, and improve my skills. Every difficulty I encounter
        becomes an opportunity to grow. I am committed to expanding my
        knowledge in technology and applying it to real-world solutions.
        With passion and determination, I aim to become a competent IT
        professional in the future.
